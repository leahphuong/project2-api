<!-- WHAT #CLASSY IS  -->

#Classy is a virtual closet that allows users to create and manage their closet by adding/removing/update items with name, description and photo link.

A user can have a 'closet' with multiple collections.

<!-- TECHNOLOGY USED -->

I used bootstrap template for my front end UI. This was the very first time I incorporated bootstrap to my web app.

<!-- BUMPERS ALONG THE RIDE -->

I had some difficulties handling bootstrap at first but gradually learnt to work with it.
I also wanted to add the search feature into my app so my users can search for a specific item but have not had time to get it done.
